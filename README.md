# Twitch Plays
 This was my simple attempt on making a "Twitch Plays" bot using python. I know its not much and is probobly buggy but I tried.


If you could please credit me for me I know its a lot to ask but I still want to be credited. Im fairly new to GitHub at the time I am writing this so if I get some things wrong could you please point it out for me. Thank you for reading this :D
